# OpenROAD MCP Roadmap

This roadmap describes the development path from v0.6 to v1.0 and beyond.

## Current Status: v0.6.x — TypeScript-primary

The npm distribution (`npx openroad-mcp`) is the actively maintained release. The Python/PyPI
distribution was deprecated and has been removed from the repository.

### What ships today

- Interactive OpenROAD sessions with PTY support (`node-pty`)
- Session management — create, list, inspect, terminate
- Command history and performance metrics
- Report image listing and base64 delivery (`.webp`, auto-compressed with sharp)
- Three-tier Tcl command whitelist (see [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md))
- `stdio` and Streamable HTTP transports
- Docker image on GHCR (`ghcr.io/the-openroad-project/openroad-mcp:latest`)
- 30+ MCP client configurations documented

## On the path to v1.0

| item | status |
|---|---|
| Docs match code — tool names, install, Docker, security | ✅ this branch |
| npm/npx primary everywhere | ✅ this branch |
| Single Dockerfile (TypeScript image) | ✅ this branch |
| Python CI removed, TypeScript CI as gate | ✅ this branch |
| Real-flow checklist executed (ORFS + AutoTuner comparison) | ⏳ needs runs with Chaitanya |
| MCP tool signatures frozen | ⏳ |
| API reference reviewed and approved | ⏳ |

**v1.0.0 will be tagged after the real-flow checklist in [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) is
executed and the AutoTuner comparison is filled in.**

## Post v1.0 ideas

These are tracked as issues and will be scheduled based on community priority:

- **Session persistence across restarts** (#57)
- **Flow orchestration** — run complete RTL-to-GDS flows through MCP
- **Design space exploration** — parameter sweeps and optimization loops
- **Real-time monitoring** — stream OpenROAD metrics during long runs
- **Checkpoint management** — save/restore design state
- **Authentication for the HTTP transport**
- **Per-command whitelist granularity** (#55)
- **Jupyter notebook support**
