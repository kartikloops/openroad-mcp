/**
 * Command filter for OpenROAD PTY session security.
 *
 * Prevents execution of dangerous OS-level Tcl commands by AI agents.
 *
 * Three-tier design:
 *
 *   BLOCKED_COMMANDS    - denied in both tools (OS-level Tcl built-ins that can
 *                         escape the EDA sandbox)
 *
 *   EXEC_ONLY_PATTERNS  - explicitly known state-modifying commands; denied in
 *                         the query tool, allowed in the exec tool
 *
 *   READONLY_PATTERNS   - explicitly known safe read-only commands; allowed in
 *                         both tools
 *
 *   Unknown commands    - treated as exec-only: denied in the query tool,
 *                         allowed in the exec tool (they will fail at the Tcl
 *                         level if invalid)
 *
 * This is distinct from PtyHandler.validateCommand(), which guards the shell
 * binary/args. This module guards the Tcl statements sent to the REPL.

 * Iterate the verbs of a Tcl command string.
 *
 * Per statement, in a Tcl-aware split (separators inside quotes/braces are
 * ignored; `;` plus all Unicode line boundaries are separators so a \r cannot
 * hide a command), two kinds of verb are yielded:
 * 1. The statement verb — its leading token.
 * 2. Bracket verbs — the command word following each `[` (bracket
 *    substitution). This catches `set x [exec ls]` where the outer verb `set`
 *    is safe but the substituted command `exec` is not.
 *
 * The bracket word is captured up to the first delimiter, so a substituted
 * command whose name is itself dynamic is surfaced rather than skipped: a
 * variable name (`[$x ls]`) yields `$x` and a nested substitution
 * (`[[set x exec] ls]`) yields `[set`. Neither is in any allowlist, so the
 * read-only tool rejects them instead of letting Tcl resolve `$x`->exec at
 * runtime and run an arbitrary command. Backslash escapes are then resolved
 * (see tclUnescape) so `[\exec ls]` is matched as `exec`.
 *
 * Comment and blank statements (extractVerb returns null) are skipped entirely,
 * including their brackets: a `#` comment is discarded at Tcl parse time and is
 * never executed, so `# harmless [exec ls]` must not be rejected on the `exec`.
 * Brackets inside brace-quoted arguments are still scanned, because commands
 * like `expr`/`eval` re-evaluate brace contents, so they cannot be assumed inert.
